This is a project that I worked on with Mike Cooley during the first Hackathon at MakerSquare. 

It is made using Ruby Sinatra and launched on Heroku. The heroku url is: http://tranquil-cove-8210.herokuapp.com/

The idea of this app is to type an artist name in the input bar, and it will post the artist top 5 hottest tracks from soundcloud onto your Facebook wall. OAuth tokens are short term and must be changed for every user. 

Currently the app will print out the top 5 songs from soundcloud onto the users Facebook wall.
